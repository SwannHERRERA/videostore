# Contribution

Please take a moment to review this document so that you can easily follow the contribution process.

## Issues
[Issues](https://repo-secret.ninja/issues)  is the ideal channel for bug reports, new features or to submit a `pull request`, however please note the following restrictions:
* Do not use this channel for personal support requests (use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)).
* It is forbidden to insult or offend in any way when commenting on a `issue`. Respect the opinions of others, and stay focused on the main discussion.

## Bug report
A bug is a concrete error, caused by the code present in this `repository`.

Guide :
1. Make sure you do not create an existing report, consider using [the search system](https://repo-secret.ninja/issues).

## New feature
It is always appreciated to offer new features. However, take some time to think about it, make sure that the feature is in line with the objectives of the project.

It is up to you to present a strong argument to convince the project developers of the benefits of this feature.

## Pull request
Good `pull requests` are a great help. They must remain within the scope of the project and must not contain any `commits` not related to the project.

Please ask before you post your `pull request`, otherwise you risk wasting work time because the project team does not want to integrate your work.

Follow this process in order to propose a `pull request` that respects best practices:
1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the projet, clone your `fork` and configure the `remotes`:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
    cd iletaitunefoisundev
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/SwannHERRERA/maze-generator
    ```
2. If you cloned the project some time ago, remember to retrieve the latest changes from `upstream`:
    ```
    git checkout production
    git pull upstream production
    
    git checkout develop
    git pull upstream develop
    ``` 
3.  Create a new branch that will contain your feature, modification or fix :
    * For a new feature or modification :
        ```
        git checkout develop
        git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
        ```
    * For a new correction :
        ```
        git checkout production
        git checkout -b hotfix/<feature-name>
        ```
    *You can also use [git-flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.fr_FR.html) to simplify the management of your branches :*
    * For a new feature or modification :
        ```
        git flow feature start <feature-name>
        ```
    * For a new correction :
        ```
        git flow hotfix start <hotfix-name>
        ```
4. `Commit` your change, please adhere to the naming convention for your `commits` as follows :
    ```
    <type>: <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>
    ```
    The header is mandatory.
    
    Types :
    * **build**: Changes that affect the system (installation of new dependencies, npm, environnements, ...)
    * **ci**: Continuous integration configuration
    * **cd**: Continuous deployment configuration
    * **docs**: Changes in the documentation
    * **feat**: New feature
    * **fix**: hotfix
    * **perf**: Code modification that optimizes performance
    * **refactor**: Any code modification during refactoring

    * **test**: Adding a new test or correcting an existing test
    
5. Push your branch on your `repository` :
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name> 
    ```
6. Open a new `pull request` with a precise title and description.

## Versionning

We respecte `Semantic Versionning 2` :
> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
>
> MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
>
> PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
